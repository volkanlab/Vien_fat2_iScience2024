This contains the code to generate the single-cell RNA-seq based expression profile of genes of interest across different ORN classes in Vien et al., 2024. 
The data folder contains one count matrix (count.tsv) where each row is a gene and each column is a cell, and one metadata (cell.tsv) storing the annotated cell information (cell ID, stage, ORN class, etc). These two files were split from the original file (GSE162121_ORN.h5ad.gz) downloaded from GEO GSE162121, based on McLaughlin et al., 2021 (PMID: 33555999; PMCID: PMC7870146; DOI: 10.7554/eLife.63856).
